# Pixel-in-Pixel Net: Towards Efficient Facial Landmark Detection in the Wild
## Introduction
This is the code of paper [Pixel-in-Pixel Net: Towards Efficient Facial Landmark Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03771). We propose a novel facial landmark detector that is **fast**, **accurate**, and **robust**.
